## Core Architecture

### Technology Stack
- Next.js 15.2.1 with React 19.0.0 and TypeScript
- TailwindCSS 4 for styling with Emotion for CSS-in-JS
- Multi-platform video player support:
  - Native iframe postMessage API for Niconico player integration
  - YouTube iframe embed for YouTube videos
  - HLS.js for advanced video streaming capabilities
- Supabase for database and real-time data management (optional)
- Additional capabilities: Axios for HTTP requests, Tone.js/Wavesurfer.js for audio processing (available but not currently used)
- No external state management library (React hooks only)  
- Static export configured for Netlify deployment with PostCSS and optimized builds

### Supabase Configuration (Optional)
If you want to use dynamic data management instead of static files:

1. **Setup Supabase Project**
   - Create account at https://supabase.com
   - Create new project
   - Copy URL and anon key from Settings > API

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

3. **Database Setup**
   - Run SQL from `supabase/schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run SQL from `supabase/seed.sql` to migrate existing data

4. **Fallback Behavior**
   - App automatically uses static data if Supabase is not configured
   - No code changes needed - seamless fallback to static files

### Critical Implementation Details

#### Niconico Player Integration (`useNicoPlayer` hook)
The application's core functionality relies on postMessage communication with Niconico's embedded player:

**Player Initialization:**
- **CRITICAL**: Never use `sandbox` attribute on the iframe - it blocks postMessage communication
- Direct initialization without `registerCallback` dependency (registerCallback is unreliable)
- Uses timeout-based fallback initialization after 1000ms delay
- Automatic state management through continuous polling at 100ms intervals

**PostMessage Architecture:**
```typescript
// Command structure (sourceConnectorType: 1)
{
  sourceConnectorType: 1,
  playerId: "1",
  eventName: "seek" | "play" | "pause" | "getStatus",
  data?: { time: number, _frontendId: 6, _frontendVersion: 0 }
}
```

**CRITICAL: Time Unit Conversion**
- Niconico player API expects time values in **milliseconds**, not seconds
- All seek operations must multiply time by 1000: `time: seekTimeInSeconds * 1000`
- This was a major bug that caused seek operations to fail - always convert seconds to milliseconds

**State Synchronization:**
- `commandInProgress` flag prevents command overlap and race conditions
- Automatic cleanup of intervals/timeouts on component unmount
- UI-first updates with eventual consistency from player events
- Time sync starts/stops based on playing state to optimize performance

#### Multi-Platform Architecture
**Platform Support:**
- **Niconico**: Full integration with postMessage API for seek/play/pause controls
- **YouTube**: Basic iframe embed (seek functionality planned for future implementation)
- **Extensible**: Architecture supports adding new platforms (Twitch, bilibili, etc.)

**URL Structure:**
- `/` - Homepage with unified medley database (searchable across all platforms)
- `/niconico/[videoId]` - Niconico medley player pages with full interactive features
- `/youtube/[videoId]` - YouTube medley player pages with basic playback
- Deep linking support: `?t=seconds` parameter for timestamp links

#### Data Flow Architecture
**Dual-Mode Data Management:**
- **Static Mode**: Falls back to `src/data/medleys.ts` and `src/data/youtubeMedleys.ts` when Supabase is not configured
- **Database Mode**: Uses Supabase PostgreSQL with real-time capabilities when configured
- `useMedleyData` automatically detects and switches between modes based on environment variables
- Platform-specific data files support different video platforms seamlessly

**Component Architecture:**
- `MedleyPlayer` - Core reusable player component with platform detection and edit mode support
- `MedleyPageClient` - Client-side wrapper handling search params for deep linking and platform props
- `NicoPlayer` - Niconico-specific iframe player with postMessage integration
- `YouTubePlayer` - YouTube-specific iframe player (basic embed functionality)
- `SongTimeline` - Interactive timeline with drag-and-drop editing in edit mode
- `SongList` - Tabular song display with edit/delete actions in edit mode
- `SongEditModal` - Modal for detailed song editing with time validation
- `ShareButtons` - Social sharing with platform-aware URL generation and native share API
- `MedleyStatistics` - Analytics dashboard for genre/artist/creator insights across platforms

#### Interactive Timeline Architecture
**Dual-Mode Timeline Behavior:**
- **View Mode**: Click-to-seek anywhere on timeline, song segments trigger playback
- **Edit Mode**: Drag-and-drop song segments for repositioning and resizing
- Position calculation: `(e.clientX - rect.left) / rect.width * duration`
- **Always validate duration > 0** before calculating seek time to prevent 0-second seeks

**Edit Mode Drag System:**
```typescript
// Drag mode detection based on click position within song segment
let mode: 'move' | 'resize-start' | 'resize-end' = 'move';
if (clickPositionInSong < 8) mode = 'resize-start';
else if (clickPositionInSong > songWidth - 8) mode = 'resize-end';

// Time conversion with bounds checking
const deltaTime = (deltaX / rect.width) * duration;
newStartTime = Math.max(0, Math.min(maxTime, originalTime + deltaTime));
```

**Critical Timeline Patterns:**
- Child elements use `pointer-events-none` to avoid intercepting parent clicks
- Resize handles positioned absolutely with `cursor-ew-resize`
- Double-click opens edit modal, single-click triggers drag in edit mode
- Time values rounded to 0.1 second precision for smooth editing

#### Component Integration Pattern
- Platform-specific player components (`NicoPlayer`, `YouTubePlayer`) handle iframe embedding
- `useNicoPlayer` hook manages Niconico player communication and state
- `MedleyPlayer` component conditionally renders players based on platform prop
- UI components (timeline, song list) trigger actions through platform-aware seek methods
- Seek operations automatically update current track detection (Niconico only currently)
- Timeline supports click-to-seek anywhere on the bar

#### Seek Operation Implementation
**Niconico Player - Critical Sequence for Stopped Player:**
1. Send seek command with time in milliseconds
2. Wait 200ms for seek to complete
3. Send play command to start playback automatically
4. This ensures seamless "click song ‚Üí play from position" experience

**YouTube Player:**
- Currently uses basic iframe embed without seek API integration
- Seek functionality logs to console as placeholder for future implementation

### Production Deployment Configuration
- Next.js configured for static export (`output: 'export'`, `trailingSlash: true`)
- Static files generated to `.next/` directory
- Images unoptimized for static hosting compatibility
- Cross-origin iframe communication works in production environment
- PostCSS integration with TailwindCSS 4 for build optimization
- **CRITICAL**: All video IDs must be included in `generateStaticParams` for static export
- Current production URL: https://illustrious-figolla-20f57e.netlify.app

### Key Technical Constraints
- Niconico API is undocumented and subject to change without notice
- iframe cross-origin restrictions require postMessage-only communication
- Player events may have delays, requiring defensive timeout handling
- Some player internal errors are expected and don't affect functionality

### Development Testing
- Default Niconico video ID "sm500873" (ÁµÑÊõ≤„Äé„Éã„Ç≥„Éã„Ç≥ÂãïÁîª„Äè) for consistent testing
- Default YouTube video ID "dQw4w9WgXcQ" for multi-platform testing
- Console logging enabled for postMessage debugging (Niconico)
- UI debug indicators show player ready state and communication status
- Platform detection and player switching testable via URL structure
- Seek functionality testable through:
  - Song list click-to-play buttons
  - Timeline click-to-seek (anywhere on timeline bar)
  - Platform-specific behavior differences visible in console

### Common Issues and Solutions
**Player Integration:**
- **Seek operations fail or reset to beginning**: Ensure time values are converted to milliseconds (`* 1000`)
- **Timeline clicks returning 0 seconds**: Video duration not loaded yet, check duration > 0
- **Child elements intercepting clicks**: Use `pointer-events-none` on child elements
- **Player not responding**: Check iframe load and postMessage origin verification
- **Seek without automatic playback**: Add play command after seek when player is stopped

**Data Management:**
- **Database connection fails**: Check Supabase environment variables, app falls back to static data automatically
- **Edit mode not saving**: Verify `useMedleyEdit` hook is properly connected to save handler
- **Search results empty**: Ensure search mode matches expected data (medley vs song search)

**Multi-Platform Issues:**
- **Wrong player component loading**: Check platform prop is correctly passed from route to MedleyPageClient to MedleyPlayer
- **YouTube videos not playing**: Verify YouTube embed URL format and CORS restrictions
- **Platform detection failing**: Ensure static data includes `platform` field in MedleyData objects

**Build and Deployment:**
- **Build deployment failing**: Ensure `public/favicon.ico` exists for Next.js build
- **Dynamic routes not generating**: Check `generateStaticParams` includes all required video IDs for both platforms
- **Next.js 15 params errors**: All dynamic route components must handle `params: Promise<{...}>`
- **Missing static paths**: Add new video IDs to respective `generateStaticParams` functions in platform directories
- **404 errors on deployed site**: Video ID not in `generateStaticParams` - add missing IDs and redeploy
- **Netlify deployment issues**: Use `npx netlify deploy --prod` and ensure `.next` directory is published

## Data Management Architecture

### Dual-Source Data Strategy
**Static Fallback System:**
- Primary: Supabase PostgreSQL database for production data management
- Fallback: Platform-specific static definitions when database unavailable:
  - `src/data/medleys.ts` - Niconico video data
  - `src/data/youtubeMedleys.ts` - YouTube video data
- Automatic detection based on environment variable configuration
- Zero-config development experience with graceful degradation

**Database Schema (Supabase):**
```sql
-- Core tables: medleys, songs with RLS policies
-- Automatic updated_at triggers and UUID primary keys
-- Foreign key relationships for data integrity
```

### Key Data Flow Hooks
- `useMedleyData(videoId)`: Dual-source data retrieval with loading states
- `useMedleyDataApi()`: Direct Supabase API access with error handling
- `useMedleyEdit(songs)`: Local editing state with change detection and persistence
- `useCurrentTrack(currentTime, songs)`: Real-time active song calculation
- `useNicoPlayer({videoId, callbacks})`: Complete player state and communication management

### Editing State Management
**Local-First Editing Pattern:**
- Changes stored in local state until explicit save
- `hasChanges` flag tracks unsaved modifications
- Optimistic UI updates with eventual database consistency
- Add/update/delete operations with immediate visual feedback
- Reset functionality to discard unsaved changes

### Component Architecture Patterns
**Feature-Based Organization:**
- `src/components/features/medley/` - Timeline, song list, edit modal components
- `src/components/features/player/` - Niconico iframe integration
- `src/components/features/share/` - Social sharing and URL generation
- `src/components/features/statistics/` - Analytics and data visualization
- `src/components/pages/` - Page-level reusable components
- `src/components/layout/` - Navigation and header components

**Page Structure Patterns:**
- Server components for metadata generation (`layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`)
- Client components for interactive features (`*Client.tsx`)
- Dynamic routing with `generateStaticParams` for static export compatibility

### Type System Architecture
**Centralized Type Definitions:**
- `src/types/features/medley.ts` - SongSection, MedleyData types with platform field and metadata
  - Extended with `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `viewCount` for enhanced sorting
- `src/types/features/player.ts` - PlayerState, PlayerMessage interfaces
- Platform-aware type definitions support 'niconico' | 'youtube' | future platforms
- Database types auto-generated from Supabase schema
- Type conversion utilities between database and application types

### Search and Filtering Architecture
**Multi-Mode Search System:**
- **Medley Search**: Title and creator name matching
- **Song Search**: Cross-medley song and artist search with deep linking
- **Advanced Filtering**: Genre-based filtering with dynamic options
- **Enhanced Sorting**: Multi-field sorting with metadata-based discovery
  - üÜï Êñ∞ÁùÄÈ†Ü (createdAt desc) - Default for new content discovery
  - üî• ‰∫∫Ê∞óÈ†Ü (viewCount desc) - Popular content based on view count
  - üìù Êõ¥Êñ∞È†Ü (updatedAt desc) - Recently updated annotations
  - üé≤ „É©„É≥„ÉÄ„É† - Random order for content discovery
  - Traditional sorts: title, creator, duration, song count
- **Pagination**: Client-side pagination with configurable page size (8/16/32/64)

### Critical File Locations
**Core Application:**
- Entry points: `src/app/page.tsx` (unified homepage), `src/app/niconico/[videoId]/page.tsx`, `src/app/youtube/[videoId]/page.tsx`
- Player integration: `src/hooks/useNicoPlayer.ts` (Niconico-specific)
- Player components: `src/components/features/player/NicoPlayer.tsx`, `src/components/features/player/YouTubePlayer.tsx`
- Data management: `src/hooks/useMedleyData.ts`, `src/lib/api/medleys.ts`
- Database client: `src/lib/supabase.ts`

**Static Configuration:**
- Niconico medley definitions: `src/data/medleys.ts` (includes metadata for sorting)
- YouTube medley definitions: `src/data/youtubeMedleys.ts` (includes metadata for sorting)
- Database schema: `supabase/schema.sql`, `supabase/seed.sql`
- Next.js config: `next.config.ts` (static export + image optimization)

**Platform Integration:**
- Player constants: `src/lib/constants/player.ts`
- Time utilities: `src/lib/utils/time.ts`
- Video validation: `src/lib/utils/videoValidation.ts`

**Route Structure:**
- Platform-specific layouts: `src/app/niconico/[videoId]/layout.tsx`, `src/app/youtube/[videoId]/layout.tsx`
- Shared components: `src/components/pages/MedleyPlayer.tsx`, `src/components/pages/MedleyPageClient.tsx`

## Adding New Platforms

To add support for a new video platform (e.g., Twitch, bilibili):

1. **Create route structure**: `src/app/[platform]/[videoId]/page.tsx` and `layout.tsx`
2. **Add platform to types**: Update `platform?: 'niconico' | 'youtube' | 'newplatform'` in `src/types/features/medley.ts`
3. **Create player component**: `src/components/features/player/NewPlatformPlayer.tsx`
4. **Update MedleyPlayer**: Add conditional rendering for new platform in `src/components/pages/MedleyPlayer.tsx`
5. **Create data file**: `src/data/newplatformMedleys.ts` with platform-specific medley data including metadata fields
6. **Update homepage**: Import and include new platform data in `src/app/page.tsx`
7. **Add static paths**: Include video IDs in `generateStaticParams` for static export
8. **Update metadata**: Customize OGP images and metadata in layout for platform-specific URLs
9. **Include metadata**: Ensure `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `viewCount` are populated for sorting features

The architecture is designed for easy platform extensibility with minimal code changes required.

## Modern UI Design Architecture

### Homepage Layout System
**Media Platform-Inspired Design** (implemented in Phase 6):
- **4-Column Responsive Grid**: Adapts from 1 column (mobile) to 4 columns (desktop)
- **Card-Based Content Display**: Enhanced hover effects with scale animations and overlays
- **Unified Search Interface**: Prominent search bar with tab-based mode switching
- **Platform-Specific Visual Indicators**: Color-coded badges (YouTube red, Niconico orange)

### Card Design Patterns
**Modern Card Architecture:**
```typescript
// Card structure with hover states and platform badges
<div className="group hover:scale-[1.02] transition-all duration-300">
  {/* Thumbnail with hover overlay and play button */}
  <div className="aspect-video relative overflow-hidden">
    {/* Platform badge with backdrop blur */}
    <span className="bg-red-600/90 backdrop-blur-sm">YouTube</span>
    {/* Hover overlay with play button */}
    <div className="opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100">
      <PlayButton />
    </div>
  </div>
  {/* Content with genre tags and metadata */}
</div>
```

### Search and Filter UI Patterns
**Tab-Based Search Interface:**
- Large, prominent search bar with search icon
- Tab-style mode switching („É°„Éâ„É¨„ÉºÊ§úÁ¥¢ / Ê•ΩÊõ≤Ê§úÁ¥¢)
- Structured filter panel with labels and organized controls
- Real-time result counts with highlighted numbers

**Filter State Management:**
- `itemsPerPage` state for dynamic pagination (8/16/32/64 options)
- Combined search/filter clearing with visual feedback
- Responsive layout adapting filter controls for mobile

### Visual Design System
**Modern Aesthetic Principles:**
- **Rounded corners**: `rounded-xl` for cards, `rounded-lg` for buttons
- **Backdrop blur effects**: `backdrop-blur-sm` for overlays and badges
- **Smooth transitions**: `transition-all duration-300` for interactions
- **Hover states**: Scale, shadow, and color transitions
- **Platform branding**: Color-coded badges matching platform identity

### Component Modernization Patterns
**Critical UI Updates in src/app/page.tsx:**
- Title updated to "Anasui" branding with larger font (`text-4xl`)
- Search bar with icon and improved focus states
- Tab navigation with SVG icons and proper ARIA labels
- Enhanced result display with card-style container
- Platform-specific badge colors and backdrop blur effects

### Responsive Design Strategy
**Mobile-First Approach:**
- Grid adapts: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4`
- Search bar maintains prominence on all screen sizes
- Filter panel stacks appropriately on mobile
- Touch-friendly target sizes (minimum 44px)

### Performance Considerations
**Optimized Layout:**
- Smaller bundle size with efficient component structure
- CSS-in-JS approach with TailwindCSS for minimal runtime overhead
- Proper image optimization warnings addressed for future improvements
- Reduced layout shift with consistent aspect ratios (`aspect-video`)

This design system follows modern media platform patterns (Spotify, YouTube, Niconico) while maintaining the platform's unique annotation-focused functionality.
